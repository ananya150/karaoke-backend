## Development Notes

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each processing component
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Performance tests with various audio file sizes
- Error handling tests for edge cases

### Monitoring and Logging
- Structured logging throughout the application
- Task progress monitoring and reporting
- Error tracking and alerting
- Performance metrics collection

### Security Considerations
- File upload validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Secure file storage and access
- Input validation for all endpoints

### Performance Optimization
- Concurrent processing capabilities
- Memory management for large audio files
- Caching strategies for processed results
- Database connection pooling

## Completion Criteria

Each step is considered complete when:
1. All checklist items are implemented and tested
2. Code is properly documented and follows project standards
3. Error handling is in place for common failure scenarios
4. Basic tests are written and passing
5. Integration with previous steps is verified

**Total Estimated Development Time: 2-3 weeks**
